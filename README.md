Advent of Code 2024 with TypeScript

## Notes to self
This is my first swag at doing Advent of Code. I am doing it because I think that long run it will be beneficial to sharpen my problem solving skills and help get me in the practice of doing daily programming tasks. To this end, I am going to do it using Typescript.

I am using TypeScript because it gives me a typed language and I find that particularly useful, but also it is JavaScript adjacent and my core interest, or more generally the thing that gives me a hook into understanding programming, is creating and manipulating user interfaces. By having a mechanism to modify the tangible/visual element of a program, I can much better 'feel' the system and learn about how it works. From there I can work my way into manipulating the back end. 

### How to approach the problems
For each puzzle, I am going to take the following steps:
1. Read the problem in full
2. Copy it into a file in this repository and turn it into a code comment
3. Make notes of any portions of the puzzle that are confusing to me, and why.
4. Write out the steps that I will take to solve the problem, including breaking down the problem into sub problems or drafting pseudocode
5. After 'solving' the problem in pseudocode I will then try to write the solution in TypeScript
6. As a part of this process, I am allowed to ask AI how to do specific tasks in the language, such as:
- Set up my dev environment to run a script, take an input, etc.
- How to create a function or use a library, but if I use a library I need to go and read the function that I am calling and put it in my notes
- I will not copy paste anything from my AI convo into my solution. 
- If I fully understand what is being presented, I may type out the solution but I should try to frame my questions in the smallest possible context such that what is presented by an LLM is just a narrow subset of the larger solution

## About this repository
I'll make notes here about how this repo works, i.e. if I add any packages, key scripts, etc.
